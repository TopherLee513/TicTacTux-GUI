#Starter repository:
This is a beginning run of code for an A Sai Loom Prod Gekt.
Initial respects go to [TopherLee513], for a spin off from his 
[TicTacTux] project he asked me for input on. I've slowly added
and altered his original plan, in order to decisively build 
a working version with full functionality and style.
This may be a work in progress and will take some time to 
gain all functionality, but will certainly be extensive in
its entirety. I've added many unused blocks only to allow 
for their use later, or ultimate elimination from this project.

#Thanks:
All utilities were created by Pat Callahan of [Cincinnati State
Technical and Community College]. They're used with his expressed
